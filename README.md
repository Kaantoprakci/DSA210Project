# NBA Fantasy Team Optimization Project

# Description
This project, developed for the DSA210 course during the Fall 2024 semester, focuses on optimizing my NBA Fantasy team by leveraging data-driven insights. The primary goal is to enhance my team’s performance by analyzing player statistics, predicting future outcomes, and implementing strategies for better lineup and trade decisions. By combining exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and predictive modeling, the project provides actionable recommendations to improve team results while applying and strengthening my data science skills.

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to optimize my NBA Fantasy team by analyzing the performance data of my current roster. Using data analysis and machine learning techniques, I aim to evaluate player performances and develop strategies to improve my team's overall efficiency and results.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project is maintained in an **Excel spreadsheet** and contains detailed historical performance data from my NBA Fantasy team. The key features include:

1. **Player Statistics:**
   - Points, rebounds, assists, blocks, steals, turnovers.
   - Shooting percentages (field goal, free throw, three-point).
   - Average fantasy points scored per game.

2. **Player Information:**
   - Player names, positions, and lineup roles.
   - Injury or availability status.

3. **Game and Opponent Details:**
   - Match dates, opposing teams, and matchup statistics.
   - Defensive ratings and head-to-head performance records of opponents.

The data is collected by exporting team statistics from the NBA Fantasy platform and enhanced with publicly available NBA player and team performance data.

## Project Plan

1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**
   - Export NBA Fantasy team data into an Excel file.
   - Clean and organize the data, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
   - Enrich the dataset with additional columns for opponent matchups and injury reports.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Perform descriptive analysis to identify trends and patterns in player performance.
   - Visualize data using Excel charts, Python, or Tableau for better insights.

3. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Apply regression models to predict player performance based on historical data.
   - Use clustering techniques to group players into performance tiers.

4. **Optimization and Insights:**
   - Generate actionable recommendations for lineup adjustments and trades.
   - Develop a strategy to maximize fantasy points in the league.

5. **Final Deliverables:**
   - A cleaned and structured Excel dataset.
   - Analysis scripts, visualizations, and insights available in a GitHub repository.
   - A detailed project report summarizing findings and future opportunities.

## Findings

Through this project, I expect to:
- Gain a deeper understanding of player trends and team dynamics.
- Learn how to make data-driven decisions for lineup and trade strategies.
- Develop technical skills in data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning.

## Limitations and Future Work

**Limitations:**
- The dataset is specific to my fantasy team and does not include league-wide data for broader comparisons.
- Injury updates and real-time data are not fully integrated, which may affect prediction accuracy.
- Predictive models are relatively basic and can be further optimized.

**Future Work:**
1. Expand the dataset to include league-wide player statistics for benchmarking.
2. Integrate real-time data feeds for injury and performance updates.
3. Use advanced machine learning techniques, such as neural networks, for better predictions.
4. Build an interactive dashboard for automated analysis and insights.
