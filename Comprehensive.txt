Comprehensive Explanation of Project Codes

1. Connecting to ESPN Fantasy League

Library: espn-api.basketball.League
Purpose:
Establishes a connection to the ESPN Fantasy Basketball league using:
league_id: Identifies the specific league.
season_year: Specifies the active season.
swid and espn_s2: Credentials for authentication.
2. Fetching Player Data

Team Rosters:
Loops through all teams in the league using league.teams.
Collects player information from each team's roster.
Free Agents:
Fetches free agents using league.free_agents(size=500).
The parameter size=500 ensures up to 500 free agents are retrieved for broader analysis.
3. Data Retrieval and Weekly Analysis

Method:
Weekly matchup and player data are retrieved using the ESPN Fantasy API.
Compares weekly rosters (current and previous) to identify added players.
Purpose:
Determine which players were added to the roster each week.
Analyze their contributions to team performance during the current matchup.
4. Extracting Relevant Player Data

Details:
Creates a list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains:
name: Player's full name.
position: Primary position (e.g., PG, SG, etc.).
team: NBA team the player belongs to.
total_points: Total fantasy points scored by the player.
Purpose:
Makes the data reusable for future analysis without re-fetching from the API.
5. Data Analysis

Added Player Contributions:
Calculates fantasy points contributed by added players during the current week.
Categorizes contributions based on primary basketball positions (PG, SG, SF, PF, C).
Filtering Player Positions:
Filters out irrelevant positions like G/F, F/C, and utility slots (UTIL, BE, IR).
Purpose:
Ensure the analysis focuses only on impactful positions.
Evaluate the weekly impact of added players on team performance.
6. Visualization

Bar Graphs:
Uses bar graphs to illustrate position-wise contributions of added players.
Each visualization is saved in the figures directory for documentation and review.
Purpose:
Provides clear visual insights into which positions contributed the most during a given week.
Libraries Used
1. espn-api

Purpose:
Fetches player data, including team rosters, free agents, and weekly matchup stats.
Key Methods:
league.box_scores: Retrieves weekly matchup data.
team.roster: Accesses team player information.
2. pandas

Purpose:
Creates and manipulates data frames for organizing position-based contributions.
Sorts and structures data for better visualization.
Key Methods:
pd.DataFrame: Organizes contributions.
sort_values: Ranks contributions by position.
3. matplotlib

Purpose:
Generates bar graphs illustrating weekly position-wise contributions.
Saves visualizations to the figures directory for further analysis.
Key Methods:
plt.figure: Configures the graph layout.
plt.savefig: Saves the graphs as PNG files.
Outputs
1. Console Logs:

Lists players added each week.
Displays position-wise contributions in terms of fantasy points.
2. Saved Visualizations:

Bar graphs showing the contributions of added players by position.
Files saved as week_<previous_week>_to_week_<current_week>.png in the figures directory.
3. JSON File:

A file named all_players.json containing player data:
[
    {
        "name": "Player A",
        "position": "SG",
        "team": "Lakers",
        "total_points": 250.3
    },
    {
        "name": "Player B",
        "position": "PF",
        "team": "Celtics",
        "total_points": 300.1
    }
    ...
]
